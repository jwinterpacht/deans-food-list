Description:
  Shopping list web app creating in React.js, utilizing Express.js for the backend, MySQL for the database.
  Reactive (automatically adapts to any screen size/ratio/resolution) web app that meets a real customer's specific requirements.

Intention: senior school project simulating a real work environment with a real customer.
  The customer, Dean, had many requirements for his grocery app.
  Through trial and error, we got most of his requirements implemented within the provided 15-week (8-26-2024 - 12-2-2024) window.
  However, we barely got in the functionality in time, leaving us no time to make it look pretty, thus there lack of CSS for advanced features (such as the checklist).
